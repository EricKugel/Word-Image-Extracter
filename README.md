# Image Extracter
When converting a word document (using Pandoc, exporting to html, etc) images are not cropped. This tool extracts and crops all images as cropped in Word.  
If you do anything weird to the images in word, this probably won't work. So don't do anything weird to the images in word.

## Usage
Have the .docx file in the same folder as main.py. Rename the .docx to .zip and unzip it directly into the folder with main.py
