# Image Extracter
When converting a word document (using Pandoc, exporting to html, etc) images are not cropped. This tool extracts and crops all images as cropped in Word.

## Usage
Have the .docx file in the same folder as main.py. Rename the .docx to .zip and unzip it directly into the folder with main.py
